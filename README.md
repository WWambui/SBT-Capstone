## 🚀 Project Overview

This is a capstone challenge from **Security Blue Team**'s *Intro to Vulnerability Management*.  
In this project I:

- Conducted vulnerability scanning using **Nessus**  
- Analyzed results to identify **critical issues**  
- Suggested appropriate **remediation steps**

## 🛠️ CHALLENGE SCENARIO
You are looking to move into a Vulnerability Analyst position within the security team, but first you have to prove your skills. You have been asked to conduct a vulnerability assessment of the intentionally vulnerable system, Metasploitable 2. You are required to work individually to conduct a scan of the system using Nessus (preferably within Kali Linux), you will host both systems yourself in virtual machines. You have been given a report template, which you must fill out completely and submit to be considered for the new role. Download the template to your local machine, conduct the scan, and fill out the questions, before uploading your report in the next section.

## ⚙️ Key Highlights

- Clear identification of **high & critical vulnerabilities**  
- Risk rating and priority for remediation  
- Suggestion of countermeasures / fixes, best practices  
- Learning outcome: understanding how automated vulnerability scanning tools work, how to interpret results, and how to take action  

---

## CHALLENGE QUESTIONS
Provide an overview of the results from the scan.How vulnerable is this system?
The Nessus scan revealed that the system is highly vulnerable, with multiple **Critical** and **High** severity findings. Many of the vulnerabilities arise from outdated services and weak default configurations.

Top 5 Most Serious Security Issues (In priority order - most important first):

>> What are the 5 most critical issues with the scanned system? Talk about each one, and what could happen if an attacker exploits the vulnerability <<

    1. Most serious issue
    2. Security flaw
    3. Security flaw
    4. Security flaw
    5. Security flaw

Top 5 - Remediations (In priority order - most important first):
>> What are the suggested remediation actions to address the top 5 most critical security flaws? Re-word them, don’t just copy and paste Nessus’ suggestions <<

    1. Most serious issue remediation
    2. Security flaw remediation
    3. Security flaw remediation
    4. Security flaw remediation
    5. Security flaw remediation
