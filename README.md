This is a capstone challenge I did from Security blue Team Intro to Vulnerability Management.
In this challenge, I completed two objectives:
    Conducting a vulnerability scan using Nessus.
    Analyzing the results to determine critical issues, and suggest appropriate remediation steps
    
Tools used:
Kali Linux,
Nessus,
Metasploitable2.
